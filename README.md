# Arduino-Uno-Simulator
Arduino Uno Simulator is a web-based platform that enables users to design, wire, and simulate Arduino circuits virtually. It supports drag-and-drop components, pin configuration, auto-generated Arduino code, and real-time serial monitoring to help users understand digital I/O behavior without physical hardware.
