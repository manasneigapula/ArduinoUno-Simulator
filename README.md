# Arduino Uno Simulator (Web-Based)

## 📌 Overview

The **Arduino Uno Simulator** is a browser-based interactive simulator that allows users to design, wire, and simulate basic Arduino circuits without physical hardware. It is designed for beginners, students, and educators to understand Arduino fundamentals through visual interaction.

This project focuses on simulating **Arduino Uno**, **LED**, and **Push Button** components with real-time behavior, auto-generated Arduino code, and a serial monitor.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Drag an **Arduino Uno** onto the workspace.
2. Add components like **LED** or **Push Button**.
3. Use **Auto-Wire** or **Manual Wire** to connect components.
4. Assign pins using the **Pin Configuration Panel**.
5. View auto-generated Arduino code in the **Code Panel**.
6. Click **Start Simulation** to run the circuit.
7. Observe LED behavior and serial output in real time.
